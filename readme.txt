Quick and easy translate your buddypress messages.

== Description ==

<strong>Adds a translate menu item in the WordPress admin back-end admin and front-end toolbar menus which translates selected text to current locale.</strong>

<strong>Perfect for a multilingual Buddypress site, this tool allows you to translate messages in other languages to your own language.</strong>
Other tools translate the whole site but this isn’t desirable for polyglots and language learners: if you are practicing conversing in the language, it’s best to see the original, and translate only where necessary.

Currently uses Google Translate.

See the plugin [Other Notes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jsm-user-locale/other_notes/) page for information on available filters.

= Do you use the BuddyPress plugin? =

If the BuddyPress plugin is active, the tool will attempt to add translate options to the BuddyPress messages.

= Recommended Plugins: =

This tools is tested with and recommended for:
BuddyPress Version 2.8.2
bbPress Version 2.5.12
BuddyPress Docs Version 1.9.3
The tool is intended to add translate links for messages and docs with these tools.
For other inputs, the Admin Bar translate button still allows translation of selected text.

Also highly recommended:
JSM's User Locale Version 1.2.1-1

The translation tool uses User Locale as the target language: if you enable JSM’s User Locale, you can quickly change the front-end language, which also become the target language for translations.
