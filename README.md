## Description

Adds a Translate button to the WordPress admin bar to translate any selected text.
Adds Translate buttons to BuddyPress and bbPress messages.


## Installation

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

(By default the Translate buttons are turned on in all applicable contexts, in Settings you can individually turn off contexts and you can see a few hints on usage.)

## Screenshots

**Sample usage** along with recommended tool jsm-user-locale which provides current user a quick way to choose preferred language. When you click the translate button, the currently text is sent to Google translate for translation to current user language.
